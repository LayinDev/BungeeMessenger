# BungeeMessenger
This was my first ever project that I did coding in Java. At the time I was into minecraft server development and found that I wanted players to have the ability to message each other regardless of which server they are connected to. Using Bungeecord API we were able to allow users to send messages to each other through the use of our server proxy which helped connect all game servers together.
